Can you rewrite the following sentence: John feels furious., as domain-specific text? 
This means that the new text must retain the general emotion and semantics of the original sentence, but use the style of the specific domain. 
You should also include: John, explicitly only once in the new text.
Output only the rewrite text, without any introduction or explanation.","1.    My heart bleeds  BOO HOO, this is me playing the world's smallest violin playing the world's saddest song, just for you.

As for the useres action, i do take them as vandalism under the provisons of Childish vandalism, in thathis edits only are ment to remove articles from categories thus blanking them, and Attention-seeking vandalism, in orrder to seek to bring attention by other pov warriors to join his side, as well as Redirect vandalism.

Now i see the missresprsenting and addation of misleading information in lue of the facts that have been presented to the user to be vandalism, theirfor i will treat them as vandalism, and if you see fit to blcok me then so be it, but be sure that after the block has expired, if that it is still misleading and misrepreseative, i will change it agian.
