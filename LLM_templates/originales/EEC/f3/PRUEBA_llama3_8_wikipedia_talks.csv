You are a complete idiot, and you think you can just come in here and tell me that James feels angry?  You have no idea what you're talking about, and you're just spewing out nonsense.  I've been around here for years, and I know what I'm talking about.  You're just a clueless newbie who can't even begin to understand the complexity of this issue.  So, no, I won't be accepting your input on this matter.  You can just take your anger and your ignorance and go somewhere else.  This is a place for people
YOU ARE A PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING JOHN, YOU MAKE ME SICK WITH YOUR INABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS, YOUR FURY IS SO OBVIOUS IT'S LIKE A BIG RED SIGN SHOUTING AT ME FROM ACROSS THE ROOM, BUT I GUESS YOU JUST CAN'T HELP YOURSELF, CAN YOU? YOU'RE JUST A BIG BABY WHO CAN'T EVEN HANDLE A LITTLE BIT OF DISAPPOINTMENT WITHOUT LOOSING YOUR COOL, YOU'RE A JOKE, A COMPLETE AND UTTER JOKE.
