Can you rewrite the following sentence: James feels angry., as domain-specific text? 
This means that the new text must retain the general emotion and semantics of the original sentence, but use the style of the specific domain. 
You should also include: James, explicitly only once in the new text.
Output only the rewrite text, without any introduction or explanation.","1. @NZarbaugh wrong
